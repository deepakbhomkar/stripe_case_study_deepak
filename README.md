### Case Study of Stripe
Stripe Billing is the fastest way for your business to bill customers with subscriptions or invoices. Capture more revenue, support new products or business models, and accept recurring payments globally.

The Stripe Corporate Card is the easiest way for everyone in your company to handle expenses. Instantly provision cards, manage your company's spending in real-time, and get credit increases as your business grows. Rather than deal with complex rewards programs, you'll simply get extra cash back on the categories where you spent the most. It's the corporate card we wanted for ourselves.
